# Hi! I'm Allison. I do data stuff.

## Career

Currently I'm a data analyst at **[CARFAX](https://www.carfax.com/)**. My department handles inbound data that external sources provide to CARFAX; I build tools and automate tasks to help source analysts do their jobs better. I get to play with R all day and help other people use it more confidently.

Prior to CARFAX, I was a government contractor supporting the **[Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/)**'s national airspace system. I started out doing administrative tasks, but as I automated a lot of them away with "fancy" spreadsheet formulas, I got to do more interesting stuff. Supporting the the [Time-Based Flow Management](https://www.aviationtoday.com/2013/08/29/faa-deploys-next-generation-time-based-air-traffic-system/) system, I established a standardized process for sustainment analysis and reporting of reliability, maintainability, and availability metrics. My spreadsheets could ingest basic data output from a database and automatically handled formatting and generating the Excel charts required for monthly, quarterly, and annual reports. Later, I got to collaborate with air traffic control subject-matter experts to research, develop, and guide facility managers to create the next generation of [air traffic contingency plans](https://www.natca.org/index.php/news/2601-cfs-2018-contingency-ops-atoc).

I've also worked in science education, technical writing, and a little bit of research astronomy. There's a common thread there: I *really* love finding ways to make challenging information clear and manageable.


## Education

I earned a Bachelor of Science from MIT, where I studied [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) (focusing in planetary science & astronomy) with a minor in physics, and graduated in 2009.

I completed a [masters degree in data analytics](https://catalog.gmu.edu/colleges-schools/engineering/data-analytics-engineering-ms/) from George Mason University in 2017.


## Community

[Destination Imagination](https://www.destinationimagination.org/) is a nonprofit that creates project-based team challenges and tournaments, with the goal to inspire the next generation of innovators, leaders, and creative problem solvers. I participated in the program as a student, and have seen firsthand the confidence that kids gain when they're given the freedom to own their ideas and the power to make them a reality. I first became an adult volunteer with DI in 2010, and haven't stopped since.

In 2014, I was a founding member of the **Board of Directors for Northern Virginia DI**, a region of the [DI Virginia](http://divirginia.org/) affiliate. I help organize and run the annual regional tournament; as a Regional Challenge Master, I train and lead a team of adult volunteer Appraisers who assess and score teams' solutions to each year's Technical Challenge, and as Head Appraiser, I help team members and team managers interpret the challenge rules, their team's scores, and the Appraisers' feedback. I also appraise at the Virginia statewide affiliate tournament, which hosts teams that advance from each region and selects which teams will represent the state at the Global Finals tournament.


## Hobbies

Sometimes I paint portraits of pets.
