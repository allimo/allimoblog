<h1>Hi! I’m Allison. I do data stuff.</h1>
<div id="career" class="section level2">
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Currently I’m a data analyst at <strong><a href="https://www.carfax.com/">CARFAX</a></strong>. My department handles inbound data that external sources provide to CARFAX; I build tools and automate tasks to help source analysts do their jobs better. I get to play with R all day and help other people use it more confidently.</p>
<p>Prior to CARFAX, I was a government contractor supporting the <strong><a href="https://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration</a></strong>’s national airspace system. I started out doing administrative tasks, but as I automated a lot of them away with “fancy” spreadsheet formulas, I got to do more interesting stuff. Supporting the the <a href="https://www.aviationtoday.com/2013/08/29/faa-deploys-next-generation-time-based-air-traffic-system/">Time-Based Flow Management</a> system, I established a standardized process for sustainment analysis and reporting of reliability, maintainability, and availability metrics. My spreadsheets could ingest basic data output from a database and automatically handled formatting and generating the Excel charts required for monthly, quarterly, and annual reports. Later, I got to collaborate with air traffic control subject-matter experts to research, develop, and guide facility managers to create the next generation of <a href="https://www.natca.org/index.php/news/2601-cfs-2018-contingency-ops-atoc">air traffic contingency plans</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also worked in science education, technical writing, and a little bit of research astronomy. There’s a common thread there: I <em>really</em> love finding ways to make challenging information clear and manageable.</p>

<div id="education" class="section level2">
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I earned a Bachelor of Science from MIT, where I studied <a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/">Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences</a> (focusing in planetary science &amp; astronomy) with a minor in physics, and graduated in 2009.</p>
<p>I completed a <a href="https://catalog.gmu.edu/colleges-schools/engineering/data-analytics-engineering-ms/">masters degree in data analytics</a> from George Mason University in 2017.</p>

<div id="community" class="section level2">
<h2>Community</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.destinationimagination.org/">Destination Imagination</a> is a nonprofit that creates project-based team challenges and tournaments, with the goal to inspire the next generation of innovators, leaders, and creative problem solvers. I participated in the program as a student, and have seen firsthand the confidence that kids gain when they’re given the freedom to own their ideas and the power to make them a reality. I first became an adult volunteer with DI in 2010, and haven’t stopped since.</p>
<p>In 2014, I was a founding member of the <strong>Board of Directors for Northern Virginia DI</strong>, a region of the <a href="http://divirginia.org/">DI Virginia</a> affiliate. I help organize and run the annual regional tournament; as a Regional Challenge Master, I train and lead a team of adult volunteer Appraisers who assess and score teams’ solutions to each year’s Technical Challenge, and as Head Appraiser, I help team members and team managers interpret the challenge rules, their team’s scores, and the Appraisers’ feedback. I also appraise at the Virginia statewide affiliate tournament, which hosts teams that advance from each region and selects which teams will represent the state at the Global Finals tournament.</p>
